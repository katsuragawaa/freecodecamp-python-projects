# 5 Python Projects - All tested using Unit testing framework



## Arithmetic Formatter
Create a function that receives a list of strings that are arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side.

Function Call:
```
arithmetic_arranger(["32 + 8", "1 - 3801", "9999 + 9999", "523 - 49"], True)
arithmetic_arranger(["32 + 8", "1 - 3801", "9999 + 9999", "523 - 49"], True)
```
Output:
```
  32         1      9999      523
+  8    - 3801    + 9999    -  49
----    ------    ------    -----
  40     -3800     19998      474
```

## Budget App
Create a "Category" class that can be used to create different budget categories.

Here is an example of the output:
```
*************Food*************
initial deposit        1000.00
groceries               -10.15
restaurant and more foo -15.89
Transfer to Clothing    -50.00
Total: 923.96
```
And
```
Percentage spent by category
100|          
 90|          
 80|          
 70|          
 60| o        
 50| o        
 40| o        
 30| o        
 20| o  o     
 10| o  o  o  
  0| o  o  o  
    ----------
     F  C  A  
     o  l  u  
     o  o  t  
     d  t  o  
        h     
        i     
        n     
        g    
        
```       

## Time Calculator
Write a function named "add_time" that can add a duration to a start time and return the result.
```
add_time("3:00 PM", "3:10")
# Returns: 6:10 PM
 
add_time("11:30 AM", "2:32", "Monday")
# Returns: 2:02 PM, Monday
 
add_time("11:43 AM", "00:20")
# Returns: 12:03 PM
 
add_time("10:10 PM", "3:30")
# Returns: 1:40 AM (next day)
 
add_time("11:43 PM", "24:20", "tueSday")
# Returns: 12:03 AM, Thursday (2 days later)
 
add_time("6:30 PM", "205:12")
# Returns: 7:42 AM (9 days later)
```

## Polygon Area Calculator
In this project you will use object oriented programming to create a Rectangle class and a Square class. The Square class should be a subclass of Rectangle and inherit methods and attributes.

Usage example
```
rect = shape_calculator.Rectangle(10, 5)
print(rect.get_area())
rect.set_height(3)
print(rect.get_perimeter())
print(rect)
print(rect.get_picture())
 
sq = shape_calculator.Square(9)
print(sq.get_area())
sq.set_side(4)
print(sq.get_diagonal())
print(sq)
print(sq.get_picture())
 
rect.set_height(8)
rect.set_width(16)
print(rect.get_amount_inside(sq))
rect = shape_calculator.Rectangle(10, 5)
print(rect.get_area())
rect.set_height(3)
print(rect.get_perimeter())
print(rect)
print(rect.get_picture())

sq = shape_calculator.Square(9)
print(sq.get_area())
sq.set_side(4)
print(sq.get_diagonal())
print(sq)
print(sq.get_picture())

rect.set_height(8)
rect.set_width(16)
print(rect.get_amount_inside(sq))
```
That code should return:
```
50

Rectangle(width=10, height=3)

## Probability Calculator
Suppose there is a hat containing 5 blue balls, 4 red balls, and 2 green balls. What is the probability that a random draw of 4 balls will contain at least 1 red ball and 2 green balls? While it would be possible to calculate the probability using advanced mathematics, an easier way is to write a program to perform a large number of experiments to estimate an approximate probability.

For this project, you will write a program to determine the approximate probability of drawing certain balls randomly from a hat.

For example, a class object could be created in any of these ways:
```
hat1 = Hat(yellow=3, blue=2, green=6)
hat2 = Hat(red=5, orange=4)
hat3 = Hat(red=5, orange=4, black=1, blue=0, pink=2, striped=9)
```
Here is how you would call the experiment function based on the example above with 2000 experiments:
```
hat = Hat(black=6, red=4, green=3)
probability = experiment(hat=hat, 
                  expected_balls={"red":2,"green":1},
                  num_balls_drawn=5,
                  num_experiments=2000)
```
